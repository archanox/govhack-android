The collection went on to win the Victorian Premier&#8217;s Award for poetry. In 2010 he was shortlisted for the same award, for Beneath Our Armour.","contactName":"Sally Williams","email":"publicity@ballaratwriters.com","website":"http://www.ballaratwriters.com","facebookPage":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ballarat-Writers/144051895649077"},{"title":"Head of the Lake Regatta","location":"Lake Wendouree","startDate":"2014-02-28T00:00:00","endDate":"2014-02-28T23:59:00","category":"arts","description":"Head of the Lake Regatta","contactName":"BAS","email":null,"website":null,"facebookPage":null},{"title":"The Ballarat Great Outdoor Expo","location":"Ballarat Show Grounds Cnr Creswick rd and Howitt st","startDate":"2014-02-28T10:00:00","endDate":"2014-03-02T17:00:00","category":"community","description":"The Great Outdoor Expo is the place to find inspiration for all things outdoors.

Whether showing affection, or expressing anger or sadness, Shanna strives to capture images of her subjects that evoke emotions in us, as well.Taking African wildlife photography beyond mere pictures of Hemingway&#8217;s Big Five, Love aims to have us read sentiment into her portraits, creating a strong connection that allows us to associate with the images on a personal level.Since working with a conservation organisation, Shanna Love has become painfully aware of the dire situation that many of these amazing animals face through the myriad pressures of climate change, diminishing habitat, economic demands, political and social unrest.From Africa With Love is her response to this: using an exhibition of her photographs to raise awareness of the rapid decline of many of the species seen here. While we will easily connect with her images on a visceral or aesthetic level, it is the data accompanying each image that drives the message home of how few of these magnificent beasts still survive in the wild.Now an avid wildlife photographer, Shanna Love sees herself as both creating sumptuous images of exotic animals that speak to us through instinct, and fostering the will to protect the creatures she loves so well.\n","contactName":"Shanna Love","email":"shanna@lovewildlifephotography.com","website":"http://www.lovewildlifephotography.com","facebookPage":null},{"title":"Writing workshop with Toni Jordan","location":"Musuem of Australian Democracy at Eureka Stawell Street South, Ballarat","startDate":"2014-07-19T11:00:00","endDate":"2014-07-19T13:00:00","category":"arts","description":"Ballarat Writers presents a writing workshop on dialogue with author Toni Jordan.The workshop will cover: Why dialogue is not speech; How to transmit the boring things your characters say; What is subtext in dialogue, and why it matters; The art of minimalism in dialogue tags; Why adverbs are the work of the devil.","contactName":"Sally Williams","email":"publicity@ballaratwriters.com","website":"http://ballaratwriters.com/workshops/july-dialogue-with-toni-jordan/","facebookPage":"http://www.facebook.com/BallaratWriters"},{"title":"Community Fun Day on the Yarrowee","location":"Redan Wetlands,  Orion Street, Sebastopol","startDate":"2014-07-20T10:00:00","endDate":"2014-07-20T13:00:00","category":"community","description":"Community Fun Day at Redan Wetlands (Orion St, Sebastopol) on Sunday 20th July, 10am &#8211; 1pm.

You don&#8217;t often associate these events with women. Anastasia Withers was one of the first women on the Victorian goldfields. She was trusted by miners to keep their gold under her petticoats. In late November 1854 she is thought to have taken her scissors, some fine blue wool and white silk, and with Anne Duke and Anastasia Hayes, created the Flag of the Southern Cross or 'Eureka Flag', which remains a symbol of the battle for people&#8217;s rights. This compelling exhibition by Anastasia's great-great-granddaughter, artist Fiona Crawford, celebrates the life of this amazing woman. Anastasia's journey and memories are explored through painting, printmaking, textiles and sculpture.
